# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Step 1: Create list from 1 to 10
numbers = list(range(1, 11))

# Step 2: Extract first five elements
first_five = numbers[:5]

# Step 3: Reverse extracted elements
reversed_five = first_five[::-1]

# Step 4: Print results
print("Extracted list:", first_five)
print("Reversed list:", reversed_five)
